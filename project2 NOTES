streamlit: Used to create a web app interface. Streamlit is a popular Python library for building data science web apps.

cv2: This is OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, like image processing and facial recognition.

keras.models.load_model: Function to load a pre-trained Keras model. Here, it's used to load the emotion detection model.

numpy: A library for numerical computations, especially for working with arrays and matrices.


Loads the pre-trained emotion detection model from the file 'emotion_model.h5'. This file should contain a neural network trained to recognize emotions from facial expressions.


Resizes the face region to 48x48 pixels (the expected input size for the model).
Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Reshapes the image to the required shape (1, 48, 48, 1) for model input.

Install Required Packages:

pip install streamlit opencv-python keras numpy

pip install tensorflow
 		because the Keras library is built on top of TensorFlow, and it requires TensorFlow to be installed in your environment. 
Installing collected packages: tensorflow
Successfully installed tensorflow-2.17.0

then run

streamlit run app.py
